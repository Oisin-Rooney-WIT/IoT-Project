# IoT-Project
2nd year IoT project

As a musician that plays predominantly stringed instruments there is nothing I hate more than having to re-tune or re-intonate the instrument before I play (intonating is ensuring the guitar is in tune the entire length of the neck by adjusting the distances between the nut and the bridge). A main cause for stringed instruments to go out of tune or need re-intonating is a change in enviroment, strings, depending on the gauge, can be very sensitive to a change in their enviroment, be that the humidity, their contact with the sunlight and the heat of the room they're stored in.

This is why I would like to create a sensor that will record these details and notify the user if there is a spike or dip in the readings in order to try and regulate, as much as possible, these changes to the enviroment in which the user stores thier instruments.
